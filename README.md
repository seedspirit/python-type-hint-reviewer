# Python Type Hint Reviewer

A Claude Code skill that automatically reviews Python code for type hinting compliance and code quality standards.

## Overview

This skill validates type hints and code quality in newly written Python code by AI agents. It acts as an automated code reviewer to ensure:

1. Type hinting is present as the primary safety device for stable Python code execution
2. Clear data structures that reduce hallucination and prevent agents from inferring incorrect logic

## Trigger Conditions

This skill is triggered when:
- Uncommitted changes (diffs) are generated by an AI agent
- New Python files are created
- User explicitly requests code quality review

The focused approach reviews only new code rather than the entire legacy codebase.

## Usage

The skill automatically activates during:
- The stage between code generation and Git commit
- The final review step before presenting modified code to the user

The agent acts as a strict auditor for type hint compliance and requires explicit user confirmation before applying any modifications.
